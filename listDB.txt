Participants have two dataset options:
Bring Your Own Data (BYOD) – Use open-source datasets relevant to specific industries or a use case of interest to you or your team (e.g., social networks, cybersecurity, supply chain, healthcare, transportation, etc.). This dataset should be compatible with a graph structure (either already in a graph or convertible to a graph). This data will be loaded into NetworkX (and then persisted to ArangoDB) as one of the steps in the Hackathon. For instance, if you want to explore some publicly-available datasets, consider the following sites:

Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection

Netzschleuder: the network catalogue, repository and centrifuge

Network Repository

Use one of ArangoDB’s Provided Datasets – These are pre-configured graph datasets provided by ArangoDB. Note that these datasets can be loaded directly into ArangoDB, thereby allowing you to skip the “Data Preparation into NetworkX” stage:

Synthea (Medical)

Common Vulnerability Exposures (Cybersecurity)

Flights (Transportation)

GDELT Open Intelligence (Geopolitical)

To streamline development, ArangoDB is providing a sample Jupyter Notebook Template with pre-built placeholders to help structure each and every step of the process.
